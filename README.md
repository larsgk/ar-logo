# AR Logo

A demo of AR using Web APIs. Based on the work done by Jerome Etienne (https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js).

Forked from https://github.com/polymer/ar-logo - hacks added to render a 'golden' rubber duck with temperature readings on the chest :) - a VirtualThermoDuck(TM).  Duck from https://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/69071 - credit to https://www.blendswap.com/user/mStuff 

Tested on Chrome for Android and Desktop (linux, WebBluetooth)
